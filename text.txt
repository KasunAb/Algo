Both of these search algorithms keep a list of edges to explore;
the only difference between the two is that, while both
algorithms adds items to the end of L, BFS removes them from
the beginning, which results in maintaining the list as a queue,
while DFS removes them from the end, maintaining the list as a

Given a graph G = (V,E) with positive edge weights, the
Bellman-Ford algorithm and Dijkstra’s algorithm can produce
different shortest-path trees despite always producing the
same shortest-path weights.

Select one:
True 



False



Both algorithms are guaranteed to produce the same shortest
path weight, but if there are multiple shortest paths, Dijkstra’s
will choose the shortest path according to the greedy strategy,
and Bellman-Ford will choose the shortest path depending on
the order of relaxations, and the two shortest path trees may be
different.

Question 9
Correct
Mark 1.00 out

Consider a weighted, directed acyclic graph G= ( V,E,w ) in
which edges that leave the source vertex s may have negative
weights and all other edge weights are non-negative. Does
Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly compute the shortest-path weight
δ(s,t) from s to every vertex t in this graph?

Select one:
True 
False

For the correctness of Dijkstra, it is sufficient to show that d [ v]
= δ(s,v) for every v∈ V when v is added to s. Given the shortest s;
v path and given that vertex u precedes v on that path, we
need to verify that u is in S. If u = s, then certainly u is in S. For all
other vertices, we have defined v to be the vertex not in S that is
closest to s. Since d[v] =d[u] +w(u,v) and w (u,v) > 0 for all
edges except possibly those leaving the source, u must be in S
since it is closer to s than v.
The correct answer is 'True'.

graphs so that it runs in linear time, the data structure to be
used is:?

Your answer is correct.
we simplify the problem by only computing the asymptotic time
complexity, and let all constants be 1. Then the recurrences
become
T(1) = 1, (*)
T(n) = 1 + T(n/2), when n > 1.
it’s possible to find a solution by repeated substitution.
T(n) = (**)
1 + T(n/2) = (**)
1 + (1 + T(n/4)) = 2 + T(n/4) = (**)
2 + (1 + T(n/8)) = 3 + T(n/8) = ...
k + T(n/2k) = ...

log n + T(n/2log n) = log n + T(1) = (*)
log n + 1 = Θ(log n).

Both of these search algorithms keep a list of edges to explore;
the only difference between the two is that, while both
algorithms adds items to the end of L, BFS removes them from
the beginning, which results in maintaining the list as a queue,
while DFS removes them from the end, maintaining the list as a
stack.

Mark 1.00 out

Select one or more:

of 1.00

a. Directed and weighted graphs 
b. Undirected and unweighted graphs
c. All directed graphs
d. Undirected and weighted graphs

Your answer is correct.
The correct answer is: Directed and weighted graphs

Question 8
Correct
Mark 1.00 out
of 1.00

Given a graph G = (V,E) with positive edge weights, the BellmanFord algorithm and Dijkstra’s algorithm can produce different
shortest-path trees despite always producing the same
shortest-path weights.

Select one:
True 
False

Both algorithms are guaranteed to produce the same shortest
path weight, but if there are multiple shortest paths, Dijkstra’s will
choose the shortest path according to the greedy strategy, and
Bellman-Ford will choose the shortest path depending on the
order of relaxations, and the two shortest path trees may be
different.
The correct answer is 'True'.

Question 9
Correct
Mark 1.00 out

To implement Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm on unweighted
graphs so that it runs in linear time, the data structure to be
used is:?

of 1.00

Select one:
a. Binary Tree
b. Heap
c. Queue 
d. Stack

If we use Queue (FIFO) instead of Priority Queue (Min Heap), we
get the shortest path in linear time O(|V| + |E|).
The correct answer is: Queue

Question 10

A graph can have a negative weight cycle when?

Correct
Mark 1.00 out
of 1.00

Select one:
a. The graph has a cycle
b. The graph has 1 or more negative weighted edges
c. The total weight of the graph is negative 
d. The graph has 1 negative weighted edge

Your answer is correct.
When the total weight of the graph sums up to a negative
number then the graph is said to have a negative weight cycle.
Bellmann Ford Algorithm provides no solution for such graphs.
The correct answer is: The total weight of the graph is negative

Both of these search algorithms keep a list of edges to explore;
the only difference between the two is that, while both
algorithms adds items to the end of L, BFS removes them from
the beginning, which results in maintaining the list as a queue,
while DFS removes them from the end, maintaining the list as a

Consider a weighted directed graph G = ( V,E,w ) and let X be a
shortest s-t path for s,t ∈ V. If we double the weight of every
edge in the graph, setting w′(e) = 2 w(e) for each e ∈ E, then X
will still be a shortest s - t path in (V,E,w′).

Select one:
True 
False

Any linear transformation of all weights maintains all relative
path lengths, and thus shortest paths will continue to be
shortest paths, and more generally all paths will have the same
relative ordering. One simple way of thinking about this is unit
conversions between kilometers and miles.
The correct answer is 'True'.

Both algorithms are guaranteed to produce the same shortest
path weight, but if there are multiple shortest paths, Dijkstra’s

Question 9
Correct
Mark 1.00 out

Consider a weighted, directed acyclic graph G= ( V,E,w ) in
which edges that leave the source vertex s may have negative
weights and all other edge weights are non-negative. Does
Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly compute the shortest-path weight
δ(s,t) from s to every vertex t in this graph?

Select one:
True 
False

For the correctness of Dijkstra, it is sufficient to show that d [ v]
= δ(s,v) for every v∈ V when v is added to s. Given the shortest s;
v path and given that vertex u precedes v on that path, we
need to verify that u is in S. If u = s, then certainly u is in S. For all
other vertices, we have defined v to be the vertex not in S that is
closest to s. Since d[v] =d[u] +w(u,v) and w (u,v) > 0 for all
edges except possibly those leaving the source, u must be in S
since it is closer to s than v.
The correct answer is 'True'.

Question 10

A graph can have a negative weight cycle when?

Correct
Mark 1.00 out
of 1.00

Select one:
a. The graph has 1 negative weighted edge
b. The total weight of the graph is negative 
c. The graph has a cycle
d. The graph has 1 or more negative weighted edges

Your answer is correct.
When the total weight of the graph sums up to a negative
number then the graph is said to have a negative weight cycle.
Bellmann Ford Algorithm provides no solution for such graphs.
The correct answer is: The total weight of the graph is negative

Question 7
Correct
Mark 1.00 out
of 1.00

Consider a weighted directed graph G = ( V,E,w ) and let X be a
shortest s-t path for s,t ∈ V. If we double the weight of every
edge in the graph, setting w′(e) = 2 w(e) for each e ∈ E, then X
will still be a shortest s - t path in (V,E,w′).

Select one:
True 
False

Any linear transformation of all weights maintains all relative
path lengths, and thus shortest paths will continue to be
shortest paths, and more generally all paths will have the same
relative ordering. One simple way of thinking about this is unit
conversions between kilometers and miles.
The correct answer is 'True'.

Question 8
Correct
Mark 1.00 out



of 1.00

Consider a weighted, directed acyclic graph G= ( V,E,w ) in
which edges that leave the source vertex s may have negative
weights and all other edge weights are non-negative. Does
Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly compute the shortest-path weight
δ(s,t) from s to every vertex t in this graph?


Select one:



True 
False




For the correctness of Dijkstra, it is sufficient to show that d [ v]
= δ(s,v) for every v∈ V when v is added to s. Given the shortest s;
v path and given that vertex u precedes v on that path, we
need to verify that u is in S. If u = s, then certainly u is in S. For all
other vertices, we have defined v to be the vertex not in S that is
closest to s. Since d[v] =d[u] +w(u,v) and w (u,v) > 0 for all
edges except possibly those leaving the source, u must be in S
since it is closer to s than v.

The correct answer is 'True'.


Question 9
Correct
Mark 1.00 out
of 1.00

Given a graph G = (V,E) with positive edge weights, the
Bellman-Ford algorithm and Dijkstra’s algorithm can produce
different shortest-path trees despite always producing the
same shortest-path weights.

Select one:
True 
False

Both algorithms are guaranteed to produce the same shortest
path weight, but if there are multiple shortest paths, Dijkstra’s
will choose the shortest path according to the greedy strategy,
and Bellman-Ford will choose the shortest path depending on
the order of relaxations, and the two shortest path trees may be
different.
The correct answer is 'True'.

Question 10

A graph can have a negative weight cycle when?

Correct
Mark 1.00 out
of 1.00

Select one:
a. The graph has 1 or more negative weighted edges
b. The graph has 1 negative weighted edge
c. The graph has a cycle
d. The total weight of the graph is negative 

Your answer is correct.
When the total weight of the graph sums up to a negative
number then the graph is said to have a negative weight cycle.
Bellmann Ford Algorithm provides no solution for such graphs.
The correct answer is: The total weight of the graph is negative

path lengths, and thus shortest paths will continue to be

You have designed a new in-place comparison-based
algorithm to sort. The list is divided into two parts, the sorted
part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.
Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the
entire list. Then the smallest element is selected from the
unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and
that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process
continues moving the unsorted array boundary by one element
to the right until all the elements are sorted.

You are now required to trace the execution of the above
algorithm you designed over the array below

Consider a weighted, directed acyclic graph G= ( V,E,w ) in

weights and all other edge weights are non-negative. Does
Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly compute the shortest-path weight
δ(s,t) from s to every vertex t in this graph?

False

For the correctness of Dijkstra, it is sufficient to show that d [ v] =
δ(s,v) for every v∈ V when v is added to s. Given the shortest s; v
path and given that vertex u precedes v on that path, we need
to verify that u is in S. If u = s, then certainly u is in S. For all other
vertices, we have defined v to be the vertex not in S that is
closest to s. Since d[v] =d[u] +w(u,v) and w (u,v) > 0 for all
edges except possibly those leaving the source, u must be in S
since it is closer to s than v.
